Select certain plots to look at on top of each other, as well as the big array
Look at positivity moments integrated

Can move on to running production 2D calculations when this is done.
It can even be internal documentation. With sources to steady state.

Make plots for the expander physics:
ephi/T on R for the expander
plot n_i / R for the expander
