This github repo is intended to store simulations and record the information from some simulations. I do not intend to make any distinctions between gkylzero and G2 projects. Mirrors is in G0 and that is all I will work on for now.

When making a new folder, do cp _sourcefolder_/* destfolder to avoid copying the outputs.

I'm calling all the sims rt_twostream because that is the default for the shared makefile. Less editing means less mistakes.
